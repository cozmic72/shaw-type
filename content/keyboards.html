<h2>Keyboards</h2>
<p>Shaw Type supports a number of different Shavian keyboard layouts,
    each with its own design philosophy and learning curve.  You will
need to install them yourself to use the app for now - in the future
we will add a virtual keyboard.  Maybe.</p>
<p>In the mean-time, visit
    <a href="https://shavian.info/keyboards" target="_blank">shavian.info/keyboards</a> to get your
    hands on Shavian.info's Keyman keyboard layouts - they are the best.</p>

    <summary>About auto-ligatures</summary>
    <p>Inspired by the JAFL Keaman layout, the app supports auto ligatures for the compound letters
        in software.  That is, you can type 𐑩 then 𐑮 to create 𐑼, 𐑾+𐑮 to get 𐑽, and similarly to get
        𐑸, 𐑹 and 𐑿.  Try it out, and you may find you will never want to turn back.</p>
    <p>If you are using a software keyboard of your own that inserts ligatures, don't despair,
        just type as you normally would, and the program will handle your automatically generated
        ligatures without deducting points, if auto ligatures are supported for your keyboard and/or
        have been enabled in setting.</p>

    <summary><strong>Imperial Good Companion</strong></summary>
    <p>Based on the original <a href="https://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2014/04/history-of-shavian-keyboard-imperial.html" target="_blank">
        Shavian Imperial Good Companion typewriter</a>.  The current version in this app is actually my own variation on the
        layout, more strongly rooted in the original IGC layout.</p>
    <p>IGC features the "yeah" vowel "𐑺︀" and the "oeuvre" vowel "𐑻︀", which
        were used on the original keyboard for composing the "𐑺︀" and "𐑻" vowels.  This keyboard automatically forms these
        ligatures as you type, along with the more familiar "𐑩 + 𐑮 → 𐑼", "𐑭 + 𐑮 → 𐑸", "𐑷 + 𐑮 → 𐑹", "𐑾 + 𐑮 → 𐑽" and "𐑘 + 𐑵 → 𐑿" pairs.
    </p>
    <p>Special ligatures: 𐑻︀ + 𐑮 → 𐑻, 𐑺︀ + 𐑮 → 𐑺.</p>

    <summary><strong>Shaw-JAFL</strong></summary>
    <p>The "Just Another Friggin' Layout" - <a href="https://www.shavian.info/shaw_jafl_keyboard_layout/" target="_blank">
        Shavian.info's experimental layout</a> optimized for typing efficiency using the Carpalex tool.  Automatic ligatures
        are built in by default - which was the inspiration for my building them into the IGC layout too.</p>
    <p>Special ligatures: 𐑳 + 𐑮 → 𐑻</p>

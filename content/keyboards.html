<h2>Keyboards</h2>
<p>Shaw Type supports a number of different Shavian keyboard layouts,
    each with its own design philosophy and learning curve.  You can use the
    virtual keyboards provided by this app, or install your own, for example
    using the <a href="https://shavian.info/keyboards" target="_blank">shavian.info keyboards</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by the JAFL Keyman layout, the app supports automatic formation of ligatures for the compound letters.
    That is, you can type 𐑩 then 𐑮 to create 𐑼, 𐑾+𐑮 to get 𐑽, and similarly to get
    𐑸, 𐑹 and 𐑿.  Try it out, and you may find you will never want to turn back.</p>

<h3><strong>Imperial Good Companion</strong></h3>
    <p>Based on the original <a href="https://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2014/04/history-of-shavian-keyboard-imperial.html" target="_blank">
        Shavian Imperial Good Companion typewriter</a>.  The current version in this app is actually my own variation on the
        layout, more strongly rooted in the original IGC layout.</p>
    <p>IGC features the "yeah" vowel "𐑺︀" and the "oeuvre" vowel "𐑻︀", which
        were used on the original keyboard for composing the "𐑺︀" and "𐑻" vowels.  This keyboard automatically forms these
        ligatures as you type, along with the more familiar "𐑩 + 𐑮 → 𐑼", "𐑭 + 𐑮 → 𐑸", "𐑷 + 𐑮 → 𐑹", "𐑾 + 𐑮 → 𐑽" and "𐑘 + 𐑵 → 𐑿" pairs.
    </p>
    <p>Special ligatures: 𐑻︀ + 𐑮 → 𐑻, 𐑺︀ + 𐑮 → 𐑺.</p>

<h3><strong>Shaw QWERTY</strong></h3>
    <p>Another Shavian.info layout, based on the familiar QWERTY layout, this makes it easier for beginners to transition
        to Shavian while keeping their existing muscle memory.  Find more info

<h3><strong>Shaw 2-layer (shift)</strong></h3>
    <p>A compact layout that uses the shift key to access the full character set, putting related characters on the same key,
    based on the Keaman layout of the same name.</p>
    <p>No extra ligatures, automatic ligatures off by default.‹/p>

<h3><strong>Shaw-JAFL</strong></h3>
    <p>The "Just Another Friggin' Layout" - <a href="https://www.shavian.info/shaw_jafl_keyboard_layout/" target="_blank">
        Shavian.info's experimental layout</a> optimized for typing efficiency using the Carpalex tool.  Automatic ligatures
        are built in by default - which was the inspiration for my building them into the IGC layout too.</p>
    <p>Special ligatures: 𐑳 + 𐑮 → 𐑻</p>

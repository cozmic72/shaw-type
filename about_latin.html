<p><strong>Shaw Type</strong> is a typing practice tool designed to help you learn and master typing the Shavian
    alphabet on your favorite keyboard layout.</p>

<p>I looked around for a tool for practicing typing <a href="https://shavian.info">Shavian</a>.  I didn't find one, so I
sat down to do some vibe-coding with the amazing Claude.code, and in a matter of a
couple of hours, he produced the web app you see before you.  We're living in the future,
and we're all doomed.</p>

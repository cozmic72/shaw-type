<p><strong>Shaw Type</strong> is a typing practice tool designed to help you learn and master typing the Shavian
    alphabet on your favorite keyboard layout.</p>

<p>I looked around for a tool for practicing typing <a href="https://shavian.info" target = "_blank">Shavian</a>.
    I didn't find one, so I sat down to do some vibe-coding with the amazing Claude.code, and in a matter of a
couple of hours, he (it? they?) produced the web app you see before you.  We're living in the future,
and we're all doomed.</p>
<p>Please give it a spin!  Let me know on reddit what you think of it, and don't be shy with feature requests!
Right now, it assumes that you are using a shavian keyboard of your own, physical or virtual
    (The Keyman layouts on Shavian.info are a solid choice for that.)  I expect Claude will
help me add a virtual keyboard in-app in the near future.</p>

<h4>Shavian.info</h4>
<p>The comprehensive resource for all things Shavian. Features keyboard layouts, fonts, learning materials,
    and conversion tools at <a href="https://shavian.info" target="_blank">Visit shavian.info →</a></p>
<p>I cannot stress enough how important a resource this is for the community.  I cannot
recommend strongly enough that you stop doing what you are doing and go and follow every single
link on that website before coming back here.  It's the best.</p>

<h4>Shavian.school</h4>
<p>Such a pity that the domain expired, but luckily it's still on github at
    <a href="https://shavian-school.github.io/?l=0" target="_blank">shavian-school.github.io</a></p>
<p>This was how <em>I</em> learned to read and write Shavian.</p>

<h4>Read Lexicon</h4>
<p>The one true source of truth for Shavian spelling, and the source of the dictionary that the word lists in this
app were generated from.  A must-have resource for every Shaver out there.  Visit it at
    <a href="https://readlex.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">readlex.pythonanywhere.com</a>.  Be sure
to read the <a href="https://readlex.pythonanywhere.com/spellingprinciples/" target="_blank">spelling principles
    page</a> if you haven't done so yet!</p>

<h4>Shavian.info</h4>
<p>The comprehensive resource for all things Shavian. Features keyboard layouts, fonts, learning materials,
    and conversion tools at <a href="https://shavian.info" target="_blank">shavian.info</a>.</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough how important a resource this is for the community.  If you haven't already done so,
    you should stop doing what you are doing and go and follow every single link on that website before
    coming back here.  It's the best.</p>

<h4>Shavian.school</h4>
<p>Such a pity that the domain expired, but luckily it's still on github at
    <a href="https://shavian-school.github.io/?l=0" target="_blank">shavian-school.github.io</a>.</p>
<p>This was how <em>I</em> learned to read and write Shavian.  Can recommend!  (Beware: the author is
using idiosyncratic names for the letters, don't get too attached to them.)</p>

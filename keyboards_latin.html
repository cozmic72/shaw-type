<p>Shaw Type supports a number of different Shavian keyboard layouts,
    each with its own design philosophy and learning curve.  You will
need to install them yourself to use the app for now - in the future
we will add a virtual keyboard.</p>
<p>In the mean-time, visit
    <a href="https://shavian.info/keyboards" target="_blank">shavian.info/keyboards</a> to download keyboard
    layouts for your operating system and learn more about installation.</p>


<h3>Shaw Imperial</h3>
<p>Based on the original <a href="https://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2014/04/history-of-shavian-keyboard-imperial.html" target="_blank">
    Shavian Imperial Good Companion typewriter</a>.  The current version in this app is actually my own variation on the
    layout that I'm developing, with auto-ligatures and some slight differences compared to the Shavian.info one.
    I'll add more info on that in the near future.

<h3>Shaw QWERTY</h3>
<p>Based on the familiar QWERTY layout, this makes it easier for beginners to transition to Shavian while keeping
    their existing muscle memory.</p>

<h3>Shaw 2-layer (Shift)</h3>
<p>A compact layout that uses the shift key to access the full character set, putting related characters on the same key.</p>

<h3>Shaw-JAFL</h3>
<p>The "Just Another Friggin' Layout" - Shavian.info's experimental layout optimized for efficiency and comfort.</p>

<h3>Auto ligatures</h3>
<p>Inspired by the JAFL Keyman layout, the app supports auto ligatures for the compound letters
in software.  That is, you can type ·𐑩 then ·𐑮 to create ·𐑼, ·𐑾+·𐑮 to get ·𐑽, and similarly to get
·𐑸, ·𐑹 and ·𐑿.  Try it out, and you may find you will never want to turn back.</p>

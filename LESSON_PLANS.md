## Design Philosophy

Each layout's lesson plan is designed with specific pedagogical goals:

**Shaw Imperial:** Traditional progression focusing on ergonomic finger positions
**Shaw QWERTY:** Leverages existing QWERTY muscle memory with gradual shift introduction
**Shaw 2-layer:** Phoneme-first approach, celebrating the unique ligature-as-key design
**Shaw-JAFL:** Exploratory journey metaphor, emphasizing adventure in learning

All progressions use frequency-based word selection to ensure practical vocabulary from the start.
